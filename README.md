Hi) My name is Semenov Dmitrii. I'm a first-year graduate student at the Brno University of Technology, Department of Radio Electronics. I have been conducting research in electrical engineering since my junior year as a bachelor's student, with outcomes in the following published papers:
* Programmable test impedance circuit development for biomedical applications; __published in International Journal on Circuit Theory and Applications (IJCTA)__, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1002/cta.4324)
* Comparison of analytical and algorithm-based approaches to the design of constant phase two-port circuit using two bilinear sections; __published in IEEE Access__, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3434741)
* Special Transfer Section for Selective Rejecting and Amplification of Bands in Equalization; __published in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentations and Measurement__, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2024.3408691)
* Emulating multi-memristive behavior of Silicon Nanowire-based biosensors by using CMOS-based implementations; __published in IEEE Sensors__, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2024.3353669)

Submitted papers:
* Novel second-order transfer section for frequency selective response generation in comb filters; __submitted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement__
* Gate-controlled 3.3V CMOS transistor-based constant phase element design; __submitted to 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems, London, UK__

Currently, I also work as an Analog Design intern in the American semiconductor company ["onsemi"](https://www.onsemi.com)

I also contributed to the following projects during my education:
* [Morse Coder and Decoder in VHDL](https://github.com/dmitrii-semenov/morse-coder-decoder), __(best project award)__
* [Auxiliary Arithmetic Unit (AAU) in VHDL](https://github.com/dmitrii-semenov/VHDL-VLSI) with verification for VLSI
* [Measuring parameters of an electronic circuit in C](https://github.com/dmitrii-semenov/measuring_electricity)

Besides my research and internship, I love sports at the gym and practicing in cello.
