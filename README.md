Hi) My name is Semenov Dmitrii. I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the Brno University of Technology, Department of Radio Electronics. I am conducted research in electrical engineering (I work on memristors behavior circuits and their implementation in CMOS technology) and in mathematical modeling in nuclear physics (I work on developing a methodology to determine correlation moments (short-range order) of the atomic distribution in three-component alloys based on the decoding Mossbauer spectra of metals alloys)

Currently, I also work as an Analog Design intern in the American semiconductor company ["onsemi"](https://www.onsemi.com)

Besides my research and internship, I love sports at the gym and practicing in cello.
