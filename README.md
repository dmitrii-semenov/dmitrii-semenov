Hi) My name is Semenov Dmitrii. I'm a first-year graduate student at the Brno University of Technology, Department of Radio Electronics. I have been conducting research in electrical engineering since my junior year as a bachelor student:
* Programmable test impedance circuit development for biomedical applications; __submitted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentations and Measurement__
* Comparison of analytical and algorithm-based approaches to the design of constant phase two-port circuit using two bilinear sections; __submitted to IEEE Access__
* Special Transfer Section for Selective Rejecting and Amplification of Bands in Equalization; __published in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentations and Measurement__, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2024.3408691)
* Emulating multi-memristive behavior of Silicon Nanowire-based biosensors by using CMOS-based implementations; __published in IEEE Sensors__, [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2024.3353669)

Currently, I also work as an Analog Design intern in the American semiconductor company ["onsemi"](https://www.onsemi.com)

I also contributed to the following projects during my education:
* [Morse Coder and Decoder in VHDL](https://github.com/dmitrii-semenov/morse-coder-decoder), __(best project award)__
* [Auxiliary Arithmetic Unit (AAU) in VHDL](https://github.com/dmitrii-semenov/VHDL-VLSI) with verification for VLSI
* [Measuring parameters of an electronic circuit in C](https://github.com/dmitrii-semenov/measuring_electricity)

Besides my research and internship, I love sports at the gym and practicing in cello.
