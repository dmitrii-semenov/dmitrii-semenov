Hi) My name is Semenov Dmitrii. I'm a third-year undergraduate student at the Brno University of Technology, Department of Radio Electronics. I have been conducting research in electrical engineering since my junior year:
* Comparison of analytical and algorithm-based approaches to the design of constant phase two-port circuit using two bilinear sections; __manuscript is in preparation__
* Active Notch filter with high Q-Factor and electronically configurable frequency range; __experimental verification__
* Programmable test impedance circuit development for biomedical applications; __manuscript is in preparation__
* Emulating multi-memristive behavior of Silicon Nanowire-based biosensors by using CMOS-based implementations; __submitted to Q1 IEEE Sensors__
* Global optimization of 25 variables function using LEast Square Methos (LSM) with further experimental verification; __experimental verification__

Currently, I also work as an Analog Design intern in the American semiconductor company ["onsemi"](https://www.onsemi.com)

Besides my research and internship, I love sports at the gym and practicing in cello.
